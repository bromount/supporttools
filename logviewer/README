How to Install the PHP Log Parser
---------------------------------

Step 1:

  * Thank Ian for writing such a great tool buy bribing him, or purchasing him
    large amounts of caffeine.  Ask around -- folks know what I like :)

Step 2:
  * Make sure that you have PHP5, MySQL, apache, pecl, and pear installed.  On
    debian based systems, the last two are from the php5-dev packages.

Step 3:
  * Install items that are specific for the progress bar to work.
    # pecl install uploadprogress-0.3.0
    # pear install HTML_AJAX-0.5.2
  * Add the extension to the php.ini file for apache.  This varies from distro to
    distro, but, I do this for the *buntu based distros:
    # echo "extension=uploadprogress.so" >> /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
  * Restart Apache
    # /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

Step 4:
  * Install the database schema.
    # mysqladmin -p create logparser
    # mysql -p logparser < schema.sql
  * TODO:  Create a user as part of the Install process

Step 5:
  * move files to a directory inside your webtree and chown to apache's user
    # mv . /var/www/logparser/
    # chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/logparser

Step 6:
  * Configure your PHP installation to allow large files.  I've done this by editing
    the php.ini file that I added the extension to in step 3, and changing a few different
    things.  Since each individual configuration is different, I can't tell you what the
    values should be, however, I've used:
    

Step 7:
  * Cross your fingers, and hope that it works!
