In fact, the trickiest part is ensuring that no one is accessing the repo. So, as step one, please ensure that you've either shut down Apache on the SVN server, or have changed your project's RBAC to deny everyone access to the repo being converted.

Now, we will move the existing repo out of the way while we work:

mv /svnroot/my_repo /svnroot/my_repo-bdb

Next, we create our new, empty repo with the correct backend:

svnadmin create /svnroot/my_repo-fsfs --fs-type fsfs

At this point, we grab the data from the old repo and put it into the new repo:

svnadmin dump /svnroot/my_repo-bdb -q | svnadmin load /svnroot/my_repo-fsfs

Now, we restore the old hooks to the new repo:

cp /svnroot/my_repo-bdb/hooks/* /svnroot/my_repo-fsfs/hooks

Next, we will correct the ownership and move the repo back to where it belongs:

chown -R apache.apache /svnroot/my_repo-fsfs && mv /svnroot/my_repo-fsfs /svnroot/my_repo

Finally, you can remove the old repo:

rm /svnroot/my_repo-bdb

Manually go through each project to perform the XML dump, so it is not practical to use this method for sites using PT across a large number of projects.

To determine how many projects are using PT you can use the MySQL statement:
select distinct MODULE_ID, NAME from SCARAB_ISSUE, HELM_PROJECT where DELETED != 1 and MODULE_ID = PROJECT_ID.  If the number of these projects is great my potential solution was to use cURL to programmatically call the XML export function iterating over each PT project.  To my knowledge, this work still needs to be accomplished.
","To get filesystem data:
tar czvf /somewhere/with/lots/of/space/allCeeData.tgz $DATA_DIR
where $DATA_DIR points to the location of the .../sourcecast/data directory.

To get an SVN datadump:
   $ ls -1 $DATA_DIR/adapter-svn/repositories > ./repos
   $ for i in `cat ./repos`; do sudo -u httpd svnadmin dump $DATA_DIR/adapter-svn/repositories/$i > /somewhere/$i.svnDumpOutput ; done

To get the Tigris MySQL data:
We need to be careful in extracting and delivering the MySQL data as we do NOT allow our schema to be reviewed or seen by clients.  To this end the commands necessary to get the MySQL data, but not the schema are:
   $ sudo mysqldump -u root -p -T ./location tigris
   $ rm ./location/*.sql

Once Apache is restarted, these changes will take effect. What you're doing is specifying a 'default' of immediate expiration.

The next set of lines tell the browser to cache any GIF/JPG/PNG images as well as any Javascript and CSS files for one day. This value can be adjusted up as needed in your environment.

- User enters proxy settings in Eclipse.  
- Proxy settings work for accessing CEE/CSFE (i.e. web pages, trackers, Docs & Files) but Subversion actions fail.

Solution: Configure the proxy settings manually in the Subversion servers file.  
 * Unix/Linux = /home/<username>/.subversion/servers
 * Windows = C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Application Data\Subversion\servers

Solution: Another solution on Windows is to install TortoiseSVN and configure proxy through its UI. TortoiseSVN writes directly to the Subversion servers file.
 * (Explorer) –> File –> TortoiseSVN –> Settings –> Network

","Eclipse reads from the Subversion servers file but it cannot write to it because Subversion does not at this time expose an API for 3rd party applications to do this. Therefore you have to configure the proxy in the Subversion runtime area.  See FAQs links for more information:

"artf43411","How to install ViewVC for Subversion?","Step 1.Get the latest version of ViewVC.Untar it.

    # tar xzf viewvc-1.2-dev.tar.gz
    # cd viewvc-1.2-dev
    # ./viewvc-install

Step 2. Answer simple questions. Default choice is okay for normal operation.

Step 3. Edit its config file which is self explainatory. Various options are there, you should read carefully and make use of. For basic working just update following options related to your Subversion server:

    # cd /usr/local/viewvc-1.2-dev/
    # vi viewvc.conf
    svn_roots = cgi-bin: /svn/cgi-bin
    root_parents = /svn : svn
    default_root = cgi
    root_as_url_component = 1 

here, root_parents is directory which contains all you repositories. It can be avoided in case your repositories are spread over multiple locations. default_root is the name of repository(set in svn_roots) to be displayed by viewvc automatically.

Step 4. Open your httpd.conf file for Apache settings and write:

    # vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

    ScriptAlias /viewvc /usr/local/viewvc-1.2-dev/bin/cgi/viewvc.cgi
    ScriptAlias /queryvc /usr/local/viewvc-1.2-dev/bin/cgi/query.cgi 

We are making a scriptalias to access viewvc through running its cgi script. The second line, which make alias of query.cgi is optional but recommended. It enables you to search for repositories, branches, files in your cvs/subversion.

ViewVC should run fine now.","ramya deepika","06/23/2009 6:49 AM","09/16/2009 3:42 PM","","Technical review","","4","Ted Kuster","SCM","No","httpd.conf","","No","","http://linuxadminzone.com/download-install-and-configure-viewvc-for-subversion/","","","","CN SVN","CollabNet Subversion","","","http://linuxadminzone.com/download-install-and-configure-viewvc-for-subversion/","","","","","","System administrator","sysadmin","","","No","","","","https://forge.collab.net/sf/go/artf43411/"

You might see one of the following error messages in the UI.
   ""Lock obtain timed out"" or
   ""Error obtaining lock"" or
   ""Fatal error - /shared/data/tracker/index/segments (No such file or directory)""

You may also be alerted to an index problem by log entries similar to the ones shown in the examples below.","WORK WITH OPS!
    - Ops needs to check for any lock files before you start the index.
    - The search plugin indexes live here: $DATA/index/lucene/<host>/scarab
    - The PT index lives here: $DATA/tracker/index

    - The Lucene index log file (segments) 'might' need to be renamed before you start the reindex.
        (A core product issue was filed for this problem - Issue 66888 2/11/09)
  
      Example: (OPS does this, if needed)
        mv /u1/sourcecast/data/tracker/index /u1/sourcecast/data/tracker/index.pcn# (i.e index.66886)

    - It is generally recommended that you check with CERT before doing index rebuild, just in case you have misdiagnosed the problem.
    - Get log entries from the site (java.log, turbine.log) ","LOGGING LEVEL
    - Make sure the the site is set to at least INFO logging level or else you will not see the Start/Finish messages in the turbine.log and you will not know when the index is finished.
    - Intermediate progress can only be tracked (in the turbine.log) if the site is set to DEBUG logging level, however this incurs a 'significant' performance hit and is probably not worth doing unless specifically requested by a CERT Engineer.","COMMAND to start a PT index (New URL, updated 2/09/09)

    *** PLEASE READ ALL COMMENTS IN THIS FAQ BEFORE RUNNING THIS COMMAND! ***

    https://www.domain.com/servlets/TrackerAdmin/action/admin.UpdateSearchIndex/template/admin,UpdateSearchIndex.vm

    - In CEE 5.1.0, this URL will start the indexer, so it is best for only one CN person to load the URL and then you can use the turbine.log is used to determine progress. It is possible for a single user to continue visiting that same URL to see if the indexer is finished, but if someone else loads the URL, the indexer will start again. So to repeat, in 5.1.0 use the URL to start the indexer and the turbine.log to track progress.

    - In CEE 5.2.0, this same URL will 'not' automatically start the indexer, you must also press the Index button on the screen. The same user, or any other user, may also enter that URL and progress will be shown while the indexer is running and the button to start the indexer will not show up again until the indexer is finished.

    - Some of the previous forms of the URL will work (especially prior to 5.2.0), but it's best to stick to the one shown here. (As a side note, it is always okay to remove the ""/removecurreport/true"" path information from a PT URL, if you want to make it shorter.)

IMPORTANT NOTE: the helm indexer status page does not show the indexing started by the above URL. The indexer status page shows the status of indexers related to the site search feature. PT uses a 'separate' index for its own search/query of artifacts. It is PT's indexer that you are starting with the above URL. It has nothing to do with the site search indexers. This is why you can look at the indexers status page when this index is running and it will look like Scarab/Issue index is not running.

Example: 200 OK: scarab/issue waiting till Sun Feb xx xx:xx:x PST 2009.

But I can update with TortoiseSVN just fine. What's going on?","A careful examination of the Windows API documentation regarding Naming a File reveals the most common reason why this happens. In short, you can address significantly longer path names when using the Unicode versions of the Windows path functions, and providing absolute path specifiers instead of relative path specifiers. Fortunately, the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library that Subversion uses transparently converts absolute paths (like C:\?WorkingCopy\file.txt) into the form required by the Windows APIs (\\?\C:\?WorkingCopy\file.txt), and back again. Unfortunately, you only get these long-path benefits when using absolute paths.","Tiffany Sonny(disabled)","04/21/2009 12:40 PM","09/16/2009 3:42 PM","","Technical review","User & Workspace Mgmt","4","Ted Kuster","","No","tbd","","No","","To see if path length is the reason for the problem you're seeing, try providing an absolute target path to the Subversion command-line client instead of a relative one (or none at all). In other words, instead of doing this:
* C:\> svn up ?WorkingCopy 
or this:
* C:\> cd C:\?WorkingCopy C:\?WorkingCopy> svn up 

do this:
* C:\> svn update C:\?WorkingCopy

","If the problem goes away, congratulations — you've hit a Windows path length limitation. And now you know the workaround. ","Why does this problem not affect TortoiseSVN? Because TortoiseSVN always provides absolute paths to the Subversion APIs.

Why, then, does the Subversion command-line client not always convert its input into absolute paths and use those? The Subversion developers have been operating under the principle that, for reasons of user experience, the display of paths in the tool's output should match the syntax of the paths provided as input. And while conversion to an absolute path from a relative one is a fairly trivial operation, the reverse transformation is fraught with complexities.

The database may also have data in memory that it has not yet flushed to disk. For these reasons, you need to actually use a database-specific tool for backing up the database to the filesystem (which can then be backed up as part of the OS backup). 

Fortunately, PostgreSQL includes such a utility as part of the software. Simply create a cronjob that runs the following as the postgres user:

    * pg_dump -Ft -b -o sfee | gzip -9 > sfee_backup.tar.gz

You can adjust the filename to include a date/time stamp or other information. The backup is mostly transparent, but it does include some overhead on the database, so you should schedule them as frequently as possible without negatively impacting the performance of the database.","","","","3rd-party","CSFE 5.2,CSFE 5.1,CSFE 5.0,SFEE 4.x","","","tbd","","","","5.2","","Project member","projectmember","","","No","","","","https://forge.collab.net/sf/go/artf41090/"

2) Examine the audit_entry table for delete events that the user performed <today> with an object id starting with artf.  Adjust userID and date fields as necessary:

    update relationship set is_deleted = false where origin_id = 'artfxxxxxx' or target_id = 'artfxxxxxx';

Don't allow any other users to access the repository via file:/// urls, and be sure to run 'svnlook' and 'svnadmin' only as the user which owns the repository. ","If your clients are accessing via file:/// or svn+ssh://, then there's no way to avoid access by multiple users. In that case, read the last section in chapter 6, and pay particular attention to the ""checklist"" sidebar at the bottom. It outlines a number of steps to make this scenario safer. Note for SELinux / Fedora Core 3+ / Red Hat Enterprise users:

In addition to regular Unix permissions, under SELinux every file, directory, process, etc. has a 'security context'. When a process attempts to access a file, besides checking the Unix permissions the system also checks to see if the security context of the process is compatible with the security context of the file.

Fedora Core 3, among other systems, comes with SELinux installed by default, configured so that Apache runs in a fairly restricted security context. To run Subversion under Apache, you have to set the security context of the repository to allow Apache access (or turn off the restrictions on Apache, if you think all this is overkill). The chcon command is used to set the security context of files (similarly to how the chmod sets the traditional Unix permissions). For example, one user had to issue this command

    * $ chcon -R -h -t httpd_sys_content_t PATH_TO_REPOSITORY 

to set the security context to be able to successfully access the repository. ","","","CN SVN","none","","","","","","","","","System administrator","sysadmin","","","No","","","","https://forge.collab.net/sf/go/artf46239/"

But if the expunger thread doesn't appear to be hurting the site, it would be a bit annoying to have it killed as then someone would have to take on the task of executing the cleanup URL periodically (1-4 times a day) until the site was restarted.

The cleanup URL is a rude cleanup that wipes the tables completely and (hopefully) quickly. It would be better if it was run when the site is seeing less usage as to avoid the probably unnoticed side-effects on users who are navigating query result lists.

The solution is to configure Role permissions and add permissions to View or Edit Project Pages as necessary for a Developer role.","Martin Fieldhouse","09/30/2009 9:56 AM","10/05/2009 3:48 PM","","Technical review","User & Workspace Mgmt","4","Martin Fieldhouse","Access control","No","","","No","","","","","","CTF/CSFE/SFEE","CTF 6.0,CSFE 5.2,CSFE 5.1,CSFE 5.0","","","","","","","","","Project member,Project manager","projectmember","projectadmin","","No","","","","https://forge.collab.net/sf/go/artf48621/"

"artf41837","How can I set James logs to DEBUG mode?","There are times were we require james logs in DEBUG mode for triage & we need to switch it back to INFO mode, as DEBUG mode occupies more space.","ramya deepika","05/20/2009 10:37 PM","10/05/2009 2:57 AM","","Technical review","Software Configuration Mgmt","4","Ted Kuster","Logging","No","james-config.xml","","No","Review","To set james logs in debug mode.
1. Back up your runtime/james/apps/james/SAR-INF/environment.xml.
2. Alter all log level ""INFO"" to ""DEBUG"" in runtime/james/apps/james/SAR-INF/environment.xml. They are inside <category tag.
3. restart the phoneix.sh and repeat the mailing scenario.
4. take the latest set of log files inside log/james/ dir by command ""ls -lrt log/james/*"" and get all the files (spoolmanager-*.log,james-*.log,
smtpserver-*.log,default-*.log,mailet-*.log,dnsserver-*.log) based on the date and latest time stamp. Normally the last set of files displayed from
command ""ls -lrt log/james/*"" will gives us the recent log.
5. Make sure the timing you tried mailing reflect the log files modification date and time.
6. Restore the backed up file runtime/james/apps/james/SAR-INF/environment.xml in step1. Restoring will avoid logging debug information further.
